## Docker Swarm

- Built-in Docker orchestration system that manages your container in production
- Redeployment with zero downtime
- Simpler to learn, yet less powerful than Kubernetes

## Kubernetes

- Orchestration system for Docker, built by Google, can also run in non-Docker environment
- Far more features than Docker Swarm
- Most popular choice in live projects, strongly recommended in 2018
