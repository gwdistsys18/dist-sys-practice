> This tutorial introduces the management of AWS EC2 instance, also includes
the remote access to EC2 instance via SSH client.

## Prerequisites

- AWS student account
- SSH client

## Operations

### 1. Create and Configure an EC2 Instance

Before you can access the
[AWS EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:),
you need to set up an AWS student account.

Once logged into the console, click on the big blue __Launch Instance__ button,
which leads to the configuration wizard, where a list of preconfigured AMIs
(Amazon Machine Image) is provided.

Simply pick one from the list (e.g. ami-6871a115 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 (HVM), SSD Volume Type) by clicking on 
the big blue __Select__ button, which leads to a list of instance types.

Select the one with a small green __Free tier eligible__ label (usually a t2.micro type), 
then click on the __Review and Launch__ button at the page bottom.

If no modification is needed, click on __Launch__ button at the page bottom.

### 2. Launch

An SSH key pair is required to remotely access the instance, so either create a new one or provide an existing one 
in the next step.

Once the instance has been successfully launched, it will appear in the console with __running__
Instance State.

### 3. Connect through SSH

If you have never used SSH, [this](http://www.grivet-tools.com/blog/2014/create-use-ssh-key-mac/)
would be helpful to know how to set it up on Mac.

For Mac and Linux users, move the key pair into the .ssh sub-directory under home directory by bash in terminal,

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/MyKeyPair.pem ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem
``` 

Restrict permissions to your private SSH key by using __chmod 400__, making sure it is not publicly viewable,

```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/mykeypair.pem
```

Then connect to instance by entering,

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@{IP_Address} 
```

The exact command to enter could also be found by clicking the __Connect__ button on the console panel.

### 4. Terminate

Terminate the instances you are no longer using so you donâ€™t keep getting charged for them.

Back on he EC2 Console, select the box next to the instance you created.  
Then click the __Actions__ button, navigate to Instance State, and click __Terminate__. 
It can take several seconds to complete.  

![Terminate](https://d1.awsstatic.com/tmt/tmt_launch-windows-vm/launch-windows-vm-18.78e67adb5892298a115d8078e10cd782f7dbd8ee.png)

Once your instance has been terminated, the Instance State will change to __terminated__ on your EC2 Console.
