## Area 1 container and dockers
>* [why docker? why now?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYDHUTHLf8U&t=0s&list=PLBmVKD7o3L8tQzt8QPCINK9wXmKecTHlM&index=23)



company shift
dot cloud to docker inc
containers are the next once-in-a-decade shift in infrastructure and process that mak or break you
90s PC wave where we sifted from a traditional mainframe to a pc distrubuted architecture 

00s baremetal to virual  virtuliazation because our servers were too powerful 

10s datacenter to cloud, amazon released the AWS solution that was the first i real idea we had

now host to container(serverless)

like all these shifts, migrating is the hard part, and docker is focused on the migration experience

### what will docker do for me?
