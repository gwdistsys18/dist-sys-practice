## Docker Container
### Beginner Level
#### [Video: Why Docker?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYDHUTHLf8U&t=0s&list=PLBmVKD7o3L8tQzt8QPCINK9wXmKecTHlM&index=23)

1. Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run. 
2. Amazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers on EC2 instances in your clusters.

1. Installing docker  
	I'm using mac, so I choose to use brew to install docker. After installing docker by `brew install docker`, I met this problem `docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.`. Then, I found the solution from [friederbluemle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44084846/cannot-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-on-macos) on stack overflow. If you don't wanna jump into that link, here is the solution.   
	
	> `brew cask install docker` Then launch the Docker app. Click next. It will ask for privileged access. Confirm. A whale icon should appear in the top bar. Click it and wait for "Docker is running" to appear. You should be able to run docker commands now.  
  
2. Running my first container  

Notes:  

1. Containers and images are different concept.  
	__Images__: The file system and configuration(read-only) of application which are used to create containers.   
	__Containers__: Containers are running instances of Docker images. Containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS.  
  
2. Container Isolation  
	Even though two containers share the same image, these two instances are separated from each other. No matter what happens in an instance, it won't affect other instances.
