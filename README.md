#### [QwikLab: Intro to S3](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/30?parent=catalog)
1. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. Amazon S3 is used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.
1. Create a S3 Bucket and Upload Image
    * Click **Create Bucket** and Input a bucket name.
    * Check config options, select versioning.
    * Exam the permissions.
    * Click Create Bucket.
    * In S3 console, click upload image.
1. Set Object Permissions:
    * Public Permission:
        * In S3 console, click **Permission Tab**.
        * Under the **Public Access** section, select **Everyone**.
        * Select **Read Object** and Save.
    * Bucket Policy:
        * Bucket Policy is a set of permissions associated with an Amazon S3 bucket. It can be used to control access to a whole bucket or to specific directories within a bucket.
        * Create a **Bucket Policy** with example as following:
        ```
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Id": "Policy1539460848531",
            "Statement": [
                {   
                    "Sid": "Stmt1539460847088",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": "*",
                    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket10132018/*"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
1. Versioning:
    *  Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.
    * Click **Latest Version** tab to change version.
    * Also change **Bucket Policy**'s Action for old version permissions.
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Id": "Policy1539460848531",
        "Statement": [
            {   
                "Sid": "Stmt1539460847088",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:GetObjectVersion"
                ]

#### [Video: Virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIdVRB5yNsk)
1. History: Virtualization first brought up in 1970s. IBM build the virtual machine on the top of physical computer and then realize multiple virtual machines can be run at the same time.

1. Hypervisor: A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system-level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel.

#### [QwikLab: Intro to DynamoDB](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/23?parent=catalog)
* Introduction: Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a <strong>fully managed database</strong> and supports both document and key-value data models. Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad-tech, IoT, and many other applications.
* Create a New Table
    * In the AWS Management Console, click <strong>Services</strong>,  then click <strong>DynamoDB</strong>.
    * Click <strong>Create table</strong>.
    *  For <strong>Table name</strong>, type: <input readonly class="copyable-inline-input" size="5" type="text" value="Music">
    * For <strong>Primary key</strong>, type <input readonly class="copyable-inline-input" size="6" type="text" value="Artist"> and leave <strong>String</strong> selected.
    * Select <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> <strong>Add sort key</strong>, then in the new field type <input readonly class="copyable-inline-input" size="4" type="text" value="Song"> and leave <strong>String</strong> selected.
    * Click <strong>Create</strong>.
* Add Data
    * Each table contains multiple items. An item is a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items. Items in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to rows in other database systems. In DynamoDB, there is no limit to the number of items you can store in a table.

    * Each item is composed of one or more attributes. An attribute is a fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down any further.

    * When you write an item to a DynamoDB table, only the Primary Key and Sort Key (if used) are required. Other than these fields, the table does not require a schema. This means that you can add attributes to one item that may be different to the attributes on other items.

    * Each item is capable of having different attributes without having to pre-define a table schema, which demonstrates the flexibility of a NoSQL database.

* Query the Table (Query and Scan)
    * A <strong>query</strong> operation finds items based on Primary Key and optionally Sort Key. It is fully indexed, so it runs very fast. A query is the most efficient way to retrieve data from a DynamoDB table.
    * Another way is to **scan** for an item. This involves looking through **every item in a table**, so it is less efficient and can take significant time for larger tables.
* Delete the Table
    * Click <strong>Delete table</strong>. On the confirmation panel, click <strong>Delete</strong>.

#### [QwikLab: Intro to Amazon API Gateway](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/21?parent=catalog)
* Technical Concepts
    * Microservice Architecture: A microservice is a software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. The idea of a microservices architecture is to take a large, complex system and break it down into <strong>independent, decoupled services that are easy to manage and extend</strong>.
    * Application Programming Interface (API): API is a set of instructions that defines how developers interface with an application. The idea behind an API is to create a <strong>standardized approach</strong> to interfacing the various services provided by an application. An API is designed to be used with a <strong>Software Development Kit (SDKs)</strong>, which is a collection of tools that allows developers to easily create downstream applications based on the API.
    * API-First Strategy: each service within their stack is first and always released as an API.
    * RESTful API: Representational state transfer (REST) refers to architectures that follow six constraints:
        * Separation of concerns via a client-server model.
        * <strong>State</strong> is stored entirely on the client and the communication between the client and server is <strong>stateless</strong>.
        * The client will <strong>cache</strong> data to improve network efficiency.
        * There is a uniform interface (in the form of an <strong>API</strong>) between the server and client.
        * As complexity is added into the system, <strong>layers</strong> are introduced. There may be multiple layers of RESTful components.
        * Follows a <strong>code-on-demand</strong> pattern, where code can be downloaded on the fly (in our case implemented in Lambda) and changed without having to update clients.
* Amazon API Gateway features:
    * Transform the body and headers of incoming API requests to match backend systems
    * Transform the body and headers of the outgoing API responses to match API requirements
    * Control API access via Amazon Identity and Access Management
    * Create and apply API keys for third-party development
    * Enable Amazon CloudWatch integration for API monitoring
    * Cache API responses via Amazon CloudFront for faster response times
    * Deploy an API to multiple stages, allowing easy differentiation between development, test, production as well as versioning
    * Connect custom domains to an API
    * Define models to help standardize your API request and response transformations
* Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda Terminology
    * **Resource:** Represented as a URL endpoint and path. For example, api.mysite.com/questions. You can associate HTTP methods with resources and define different backend targets for each method. In a microservices architecture, a resource would represent a single microservice within your system.
    * **Method:** In API Gateway, a method is identified by the combination of a resource path and an HTTP verb, such as GET, POST, and DELETE.
    * **Method Request:** The method request settings in API gateway store the methods authorization settings and define the URL Query String parameters and HTTP Request Headers that are received from the client.
    * **Integration Request:** The integration request settings define the backend target used with the method. It is also where you can define mapping templates, to transform the incoming request to match what the backend target is expecting.
    * **Integration Response:** The integration response settings is where the mappings are defined between the response from the backend target and the method response in API Gateway. You can also transform the data that is returned from your backend target to fit what your end users and applications are expecting.
    * **Method Response:** The method response settings define the method response types, their headers and content types.
    * **Model:** In API Gateway, a model defines the format, also known as the schema or shape, of some data. You create and use models to make it easier to create mapping templates. Because API Gateway is designed to work primarily with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-formatted data, API Gateway uses JSON Schema to define the expected schema of the data.
    * **Stage:** In API Gateway, a stage defines the path through which an API deployment is accessible. This is commonly used to deviate between versions, as well as development vs production endpoints, etc.
    * **Blueprint:** A Lambda blueprint is an example lambda function that can be used as a base to build out new Lambda functions.

    * Create an Amazon DynamoDB Table as we do in previous tutorial.
    ![Create Table](./img/createtable.png)
    * Create an IAM Role for Your Lambda function
        * Every Lambda function has an IAM role associated with it. This role defines what other AWS services the function is allowed to interact with.
        * Use the IAM console to create a new role. Name it WildRydesLambda and select AWS Lambda for the role type. You'll need to attach policies that grant your function permissions to write to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and put items to your DynamoDB table.
        * Attach the managed policy called AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole to this role to grant the necessary CloudWatch Logs permissions. Also, create a custom inline policy for your role that allows the ddb:PutItem action for the table you created in the previous section.

    * Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to cloud computing that facilitates network management and enables programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring.

1. Main Goal of SDN
    * Make network to be open and programmable.

1. 3 layer model of Operating System (analogy for an SDN model)
    * Application Layer
    * Operating System with Core Service as middleware.
    * Hardware Layer with CPU, storage, memory and network as infrastructure.

1. 3 layer model of SDN
    * Network Application Layer.
    * Network Operating System with Core Service or called as SDN Controller.
    * Network forwarding devices as infrastructure.

1. Layer details
    * Network Applications
    * Application Interfaces:
        * Java API
        * Northbound (e.g. RESTConf)
    * SDN Controller/Control Panel
        * Topology Service
        * Inventory Service
        * Statistic Service
        * Host Tracking
    * SouthBound Interfaces:
        * OpenFlow
        * OVSDB
        * NETCONF
        * SNMP
    * Forwarding Devices/Data Plane

1. Availability and Scalability
    * Logically Centralized rather than Physically Centralized.
    * Cluster Networking Operating System.
    * Separate Networking Operating System into different regions.
    * SDN Controller is designed in hierarchy.

1. SDN vs traditional networks
    * Traditional networks nodes have a data plane and a control plane both contained within a single physic system.
    * Traditional networks nodes are proprietary locked boxes. The control plane is chained to the data plane and both are coupled together in a single networking nodes.
    * In traditional networks, each node is configured individually. These control planes must communicate using distributed protocols. This paradigm is typically complex.

#### [Lab: DevOps Docker Beginners Guide](https://training.play-with-docker.com/ops-s1-hello/)

1. Terminology
    * Images: The file system and configuration of our application which are used to create containers.
    * Containers:  Running instances of Docker images — containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers, and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS.
    * Docker daemon: The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers.
    * Docker client: The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon.
    * Docker Store: Store is, among other things, a registry of Docker images.

1. Run Container
```
docker container run hello-world
```
![Hello World What Happened](/img/ops-basics-hello-world.svg)
1. Docker Image
```
docker image pull alpine // The pull command fetches the alpine image from the Docker registry
docker container run alpine ls -l
```
![Docker Run Details](/img/ops-basics-run-details.svg)
1. Container Isolation: a critical security concept in the world of Docker containers. Even though each *docker container run* command used the same alpine image, each execution was a separate, isolated container. Each container has a separate filesystem and runs in a different namespace; by default a container has no way of interacting with other containers, even those from the same image. Let’s try another exercise to learn more about isolation.

CloudFront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers called <em>edge locations</em>. When a user requests content through CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance. If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately. If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.</p>

#### [AWS Tutorial: Analyze Big Data with Hadoop](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/analyze-big-data/?trk=gs_card)

1. Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. By using these frameworks and related open-source projects, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig, you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. Additionally, you can use Amazon EMR to transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and databases, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.

1. The central component of Amazon EMR is the cluster. A cluster is a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Each instance in the cluster is called a node. Each node has a role within the cluster, referred to as the node type. Amazon EMR also installs different software components on each node type, giving each node a role in a distributed application like Apache Hadoop.

1. The node types in Amazon EMR
    * **Master node**: A node that manages the cluster by running software components to coordinate the distribution of data and tasks among other nodes for processing. The master node tracks the status of tasks and monitors the health of the cluster. Every cluster has a master node, and it's possible to create a single-node cluster with only the master node.
    * **Core node**: A node with software components that run tasks and store data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on your cluster. Multi-node clusters have at least one core node.
    * **Task node**: A node with software components that only runs tasks and does not store data in HDFS. Task nodes are optional.
    ![Cluster Node Type](./img/cluster-node-type.png)

1. Processing Data
    * Submitting Jobs Directly to Applications
    * Running Steps in Cluster
        * Submit an input dataset for processing.
        * Process the output of the first step by using a Pig program.
        * Process a second input dataset by using a Hive program.
        * Write an output dataset.

1. Cluster Lifecycle
    * Amazon EMR first provisions EC2 instances in the cluster for each instance according to your specifications. For more information, see Configure Cluster Hardware and Networking. For all instances, Amazon EMR uses the default AMI for Amazon EMR or a custom Amazon Linux AMI that you specify. For more information, see Using a Custom AMI. During this phase, the cluster state is *STARTING*.
    * Amazon EMR runs bootstrap actions that you specify on each instance. You can use bootstrap actions to install custom applications and perform customizations that you require. For more information, see Create Bootstrap Actions to Install Additional Software. During this phase, the cluster state is *BOOTSTRAPPING*.
    * Amazon EMR installs the native applications that you specify when you create the cluster, such as Hive, Hadoop, Spark, and so on.
    * After bootstrap actions are successfully completed and native applications are installed, the cluster state is *RUNNING*. At this point, you can connect to cluster instances, and the cluster sequentially runs any steps that you specified when you created the cluster. You can submit additional steps, which run after any previous steps complete.
    * After steps run successfully, the cluster goes into a WAITING state. If a cluster is configured to auto-terminate after the last step is complete, it goes into a *SHUTTING_DOWN* state.
    * After all instances are terminated, the cluster goes into the *COMPLETED* state.

1. Benefits of Using Amazon EMR
    * **Cost Savings**: pricing depends on the instance type and number of EC2 instances that you deploy and the region in which you launch your cluster.
    * **AWS Integration**: integrates with other AWS services to provide capabilities and functionality related to networking, storage, security, and so on, for your cluster.
    * **Deployment**: cluster consists of EC2 instances, which perform the work that you submit to your cluster.
    * **Scalability and Flexibility**: provides flexibility to scale your cluster up or down as your computing needs change.
    * **Reliability**: monitors nodes in your cluster and automatically terminates and replaces an instance in case of failure.
    * **Security**: leverages other AWS services, such as IAM and Amazon VPC, and features such as Amazon EC2 key pairs, to help you secure your clusters and data.
    * **Monitoring**: use the Amazon EMR management interfaces and log files to troubleshoot cluster issues.
    * **Management Interfaces**
        * Console

1. Model Deployment
    * Deploying a model using Amazon SageMaker hosting services
        * **Create a model in Amazon SageMaker**—By creating a model, you tell Amazon SageMaker where it can find the model components. This includes the S3 path where the model artifacts are stored and the Docker registry path for the image that contains the inference code. In subsequent deployment steps, you specify the model by name.
        * **Create an endpoint configuration for an HTTPS endpoint**—You specify the name of one or more models in production variants and the ML compute instances that you want Amazon SageMaker to launch to host them.
        * **Create an HTTPS endpoint**—Provide the endpoint configuration to Amazon SageMaker. The service launches the ML compute instances and deploys the model or models as specified in the configuration.
    * Batch Transform
        * To Create a transform job includes the following information:
            * The path to the S3 bucket where you've stored the data to transform.
            * The compute resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to use for the transform job. Compute resources are ML compute instances that are managed by Amazon SageMaker.
            * The path to the S3 bucket where you want to store the output of the job.
            * The name of the model that you want to use in the transform job.
        * The workflow of a batch transform job
        ![Batch Transform](./img/batch-transform.png)

1. Validating Machine Learning Models
    * **Offline testing**: Use historical, not live, data to send requests to the model for inferences.
        * **Validating using a "holdout set"**—Machine learning practitioners often set aside a part of the data as a "holdout set."
        * **k-fold validation**—In this validation approach, you split the example dataset into k parts. You treat each of these parts as a holdout set for k training runs, and use the other k-1 parts as the training set for that run. You produce k models using a similar process, and aggregate the models to generate your final model. The value k is typically in the range of 5-10.
    * **Online testing with live data**: Amazon SageMaker supports deploying multiple models (called production variants) to a single Amazon SageMaker endpoint. You configure the production variants so that a small portion of the live traffic goes to the model that you want to validate. For example, you might choose to send 10% of the traffic to a model variant for evaluation. After you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can route 100% traffic to the updated model.

1. The Amazon SageMaker Programming Model
    * **Use the Amazon SageMaker console**—With the console, you don't write any code. You use the console UI to start model training or deploy a model. The console works well for simple jobs, where you use a built-in training algorithm and you don't need to preprocess training data.
    * **Modify the example Jupyter notebooks**—Amazon SageMaker provides several Jupyter notebooks that train and deploy models using specific algorithms and datasets. Start with a notebook that has a suitable algorithm and modify it to accommodate your data source and specific needs.
    * **Write model training and inference code from scratch**—Amazon SageMaker provides both an AWS SDK and a high-level Python library that you can use in your code to start model training jobs and deploy the resulting models.
        * **The high-level Python library**—The Python library simplifies model training and deployment. In addition to authenticating your requests, the library abstracts platform specifics by providing simple methods and default parameters.
        * **The AWS SDK**—The SDKs provide methods that correspond to the Amazon SageMaker API (see Actions). Use the SDKs to programmatically start a model training job and host the model in Amazon SageMaker. SDK clients authenticate your requests by using your access keys, so you don't need to write authentication code. They are available in multiple languages and platforms.
    * **Integrate Amazon SageMaker into your Apache Spark workflow**—Amazon SageMaker provides a library for calling its APIs from Apache Spark. With it, you can use Amazon SageMaker-based estimators in an Apache Spark pipeline.

#### [Build a Serverless Real-Time Data Processing App](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-real-time-data-processing-app-lambda-kinesis-s3-dynamodb-cognito-athena/?trk=gs_card)

1. Overview
    * **Build a data stream**: Create a stream in Kinesis and write to and read from the stream to track Wild Rydes unicorns on the live map. In this module you'll also create an Amazon Cognito identity pool to grant live map access to your stream.
    * **Aggregate data**: Build a Kinesis Data Analytics application to read from the stream and aggregate metrics like unicorn health and distance traveled each minute.
    * **Process streaming data**: Persist aggregate data from the application to a backend database stored in DynamoDB and run queries against those data.
    * **Store & query data**: Use Kinesis Data Firehose to flush the raw sensor data to an S3 bucket for archival purposes. Using Athena, you'll run SQL queries against the raw data for ad-hoc analyses.
