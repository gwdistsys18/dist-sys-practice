    Shiftting from host to docker is the trend now.
    Docker focus on the migrating experience and developers.
    Docker is faster in almost every phase of the software development.
    Container can reduce the complexity of an application. 
    Container can reduce the infrastructure cost and the time consuming in maintainance. 
Lab:
A few terminologies: images: Which is used to create containers.
                     containers: Running instances of Docker images.A container includes an application and all 
                                 of its dependencies. It share the kernel with other containers.
                     Docker Store: a registry of docker images.
A few useful command: 
                     docker image pull < image name >: download the corresponding image.
                     docker container run < image name>: create a container of the given image.
                     docker container ls: list the container that are currently running
 Key points:
          1. Docker engine runs on top of the linux kernel. And the containers runs on top of the docker engine.
          2. If a user needs to create a container of a given image. First, this image must be stored locally
          3. These containers are isolated from each other, they cann't interact with each other.
          4. When a container is running, the user can send command to the container or get into 
             the container shell. 
          5. You can create multiple containers for one image, and these containers cann't interact with each other.
             They all have their own ID.
