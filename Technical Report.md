# Some Understanding of Distributed Systems
## How to understand the word "distributed"?
"Distributed Systems", "Distributed Computing", "Distributed Algorithms". So what is the specific meaning of "distributied" here? In a narrow sense, it means that multiple PCs are geographically distributed in different places.  

## Distributed Systems
__Distributed system__: A group of computers (called nodes) that can run independently. Each node uses a computer network for information transfer to achieve a common "target or task."  

__Distributed program__: A computer program that runs on a distributed system.  

__Distributed Computing__: Use distributed system solutions to compute problems. In distributed computing, a problem is refined into multiple tasks, each of which can be done by one or more computers.  

Distinguish distributed computing  parallel computing: The commonality is that large tasks are divided into small tasks.  

Differences:  
* Distributed computing: Based on multiple PCs, each PC completes a different part of the same task. The task is decomposed and the smaller tasks are independent of each other. The results between the nodes hardly affect each other, and the real-time requirements are not very high.  
* Parallel computing: Based on the same PC, use the multicore of the CPU to accomplish a task together.  

### Distributed Operating System  
Responsible for managing distributed processing system resources and controlling distributed program operations. It differs from centralized operating systems in terms of resource management, process communication, and system architecture.  

### Distributed File System  
Distributed file systems have the ability to perform remote file access, and manage/access files distributed across the network in a transparent manner.  

### Distributed Programming and Compiler Interpretation System
Distributed programming language is used to write distributed programs that run on distributed computer systems. A distributed program consists of several program modules that can be executed independently, and they are executed simultaneously on multiple computers in a distributed processing system. It has three characteristics compared to a centralized programming language: distribution, communication, and robustness.  

### Hierarchical Application
Hierarchical applications can be partitioned by number of layers, and information can be transferred from the data layer (usually stored in the database) to the presentation layer (displayed on the client). Usually each layer runs in a different system than the other layers, or in different process spaces in the same system. Layering benefits: Reduce the complexity of the entire application; enable applications to scale better and keep up with the needs of enterprise development.  

* Two-tier application: Typical architecture, a client PC (front end) and a web server (backend) with a database. Logically based on the physical location of them. Usually the client contains most of the business logic. As the database and stored procedures evolve, the SQL language allows business logic to be stored and executed in the database server.
* Three-tier application: The most commonly used three-tier application structure includes a user service layer (presentation layer), a business service layer and a data service layer. The business logic layer is separated from the user interface and data source. Distributed applications are usually divided into three or more layers due to the functional limitations of a two-tier application(i.e. the client/server architecture). Each layer of components performs a specific type of processing.  

### Distributed Database
__My conclusion__:  
Distributed database consists of multiple databases (called sites) that are distributed in different places geographically which are connected based on a computer network. The distributed DBMS is used to manage each site in a unified manner, and each site is logically unified. It seems to be managing data on a single site based on the transparency of data distribution. The advantages are fault tolerance and increased access speed.  

__Official explanation__: A distributed database is a logically unified database composed of a plurality of physically dispersed database units connected by a computer network. Each connected database unit is called a site or node. A distributed database has a unified database management system for management, called a distributed database management system.  

The basic characteristics of distributed databases include: physical distribution, logical integrity, and site autonomy. Other features that can be derived from these three basic characteristics are: data distribution transparency, control mechanism combining concentration and autonomy, appropriate data redundancy, and distribution of transaction management. The distributed database is divided into heterogeneous distributed database and isomorphic distributed database according to the similarities and differences of the data model of the database management system in each site. According to the type of control system, it is divided into global control centralized type, global control distributed type and global control variable type.  

## Hadoop , HDFS, HBase, Hive
__My conclusion__:  
__Hadoop__ is a distributed system infrastructure framework. Based on this framework, the development of distributed applications leverages the power of clustered high-speed computing and storage. This is similar to the development of parallel programs based on NVIDIA's CUDA parallel architecture which leverages the parallel computing power of the GPU.  

__HDFS__ is the file system of Hadoop. Based on HDFS, you can manipulate files, such as create, delete, edit, rename, and so on.  

__Hbase__: A database system based on the Hadoop architecture. It is not a relational database. In addition, HBase is based on column rather than row based schema.  

__Hive__: A high-level language based on Hbase. Similar to SQL —— Computer language for accessing and processing relational databases.  

__Wiki explanation__: 
Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model. Originally designed for computer clusters built from commodity hardware — still the common use — it has also found use on clusters of higher-end hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be automatically handled by the framework.  

The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part, known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a processing part which is a MapReduce programming model. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. It then transfers packaged code into nodes to process the data in parallel. This approach takes advantage of data locality, where nodes manipulate the data they have access to. This allows the dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are distributed via high-speed networking.  

The Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is a distributed, scalable, and portable file system written in Java for the Hadoop framework. Some consider it to instead be a data store due to its lack of POSIX compliance, but it does provide shell commands and Java application programming interface (API) methods that are similar to other file systems. A Hadoop is divided into HDFS and MapReduce. HDFS is used for storing the data and MapReduce is used for the Processing the Data. HDFS has five services as follows:  
1. Name Node  
2. Secondary Name Node  
3. Job tracker  
4. Data Node  
5. Task Tracker  

Top three are Master Services/Demons/Nodes and bottom two are Slave Services. Master Services can communicate with each other and in the same way Slave services can communicate with each other. Name Node is a master node and Data node is its corresponding Slave node and can talk with each other.  

HBase is an open-source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's Bigtable and written in Java. It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), providing Bigtable-like capabilities for Hadoop. That is, it provides a fault-tolerant way of storing large quantities of sparse data (small amounts of information caught within a large collection of empty or unimportant data, such as finding the 50 largest items in a group of 2 billion records, or finding the non-zero items representing less than 0.1% of a huge collection).  

HBase features compression, in-memory operation, and Bloom filters on a per-column basis as outlined in the original Bigtable paper. Tables in HBase can serve as the input and output for MapReduce jobs run in Hadoop, and may be accessed through the Java API but also through REST, Avro or Thrift gateway APIs. HBase is a column-oriented key-value data store and has been idolized widely because of its lineage with Hadoop and HDFS. HBase runs on top of HDFS and is well-suited for faster read and write operations on large datasets with high throughput and low input/output latency.  

Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis. Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop. Traditional SQL queries must be implemented in the MapReduce Java API to execute SQL applications and queries over distributed data. Hive provides the necessary SQL abstraction to integrate SQL-like queries (HiveQL) into the underlying Java without the need to implement queries in the low-level Java API.  

__Hadoop Architecture__:  
Hadoop evolved from a three-tier structure of 1.0 to a current four-tier architecture after its 2.0 version changed resource management from MapReduce to a generic framework.  
1. Bottom layer —— storage layer, file system HDFS
2. Middle layer —— resource and data management, YARN and Sentry
3. Upper layer —— MapReduce, Impala, Spark and other computing engines
4. Top layer —— advanced packaging tools based on MapReduce, Spark and other computing engines, e.g. Hive, Pig, Mahout, etc.

* Storage layer  
HDFS has become the standard for big data disk storage, and it is used for online storage of massive log files.  
* Management layer  
Management is divided into data management and resource management.  
* Computation engine layer  
* Service layer  
The service layer is the programming API details of the underlying engine, providing a more abstract access model for business people, such as Pig, Hive, and so on.
