## Isolation

It is basically a sandbox for a process. The process runs in the container has its own proces, name space and cgroups. 

This is a critical security concept in the world of Docker containers! Even though each `docker container run` command used the same alpine image, each execution was a separate, isolated container. Each container has a separate filesystem and runs in a different namespace; By default a container has no way of interactint with other containers, even those from the same image. Let's try another exercise to learn more about isolation.
