      <description>What are Containers? A small taste A container is a software that packages software and code with all of it&amp;rsquo;s dependencies. This allows an application to run from one environment to another seemlessly. Popularized in 2013, a Docker container image is lighter than a VM, is standalone and can execute everything you need to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
There are various form of containers (lmctfy, Turbo, Docker, ROCKET, among others), but in this entry we will mostly focus on Docker&amp;rsquo;s version.</description>
